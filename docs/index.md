## About

Testcontainers-Go is a Go package that makes it simple to create and clean up container-based dependencies for
automated integration/smoke tests. The clean, easy-to-use API enables developers to programmatically define containers
that should be run as part of a test and clean up those resources when the test is done.

This project is opensource and you can have a look at the code on
[GitHub](https://github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go).

## GoDoc

Inline documentation and docs where the code live is crucial for us. Go has nice support for them and we provide
examples as well. Check it out at
[pkg.go.dev/github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go).
