# Using Docker Compose

Similar to generic containers support, it's also possible to run a bespoke set
of services specified in a docker-compose.yml file.

This is intended to be useful on projects where Docker Compose is already used
in dev or other environments to define services that an application may be
dependent upon.

## Using `docker-compose` directly

```
go get github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go/modules/compose
```

!!!warning

	Given the version includes the Compose dependency, and the Docker folks added [a replace directive until the upcoming Docker 22.06 release is out](https://github.com/docker/compose/issues/9946#issuecomment-1288923912),
	we were forced to add it too, causing consumers of _Testcontainers for Go_ to add the following replace directive to their `go.mod` files.
	We expect this to be removed in the next releases of _Testcontainers for Go_.

	```
	replace (

		github.com/cucumber/godog => github.com/laurazard/godog v0.0.0-20220922095256-4c4b17abdae7

		// For k8s dependencies, we use a replace directive, to prevent them being
		// upgraded to the version specified in containerd, which is not relevant to the
		// version needed.
		// See https://github.com/docker/buildx/pull/948 for details.
		// https://github.com/docker/buildx/blob/v0.8.1/go.mod#L62-L64
		k8s.io/api => k8s.io/api v0.22.4
		k8s.io/apimachinery => k8s.io/apimachinery v0.22.4
		k8s.io/client-go => k8s.io/client-go v0.22.4
	)
	```

Because `docker-compose` v2 is implemented in Go it's possible for _Testcontainers for Go_ to
use [`github.com/docker/compose`](https://github.com/docker/compose) directly and skip any process execution/_docker-compose-in-a-container_ scenario.
The `ComposeStack` API exposes this variant of using `docker-compose` in an easy way.

### Basic examples

Use the convenience `NewDockerCompose(...)` constructor which creates a random identifier and takes a variable number
of stack files:

```go
package example_test

import (
	"context"
	"testing"

	"github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
	tc "github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go/modules/compose"
)

func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {
	compose, err := tc.NewDockerCompose("testresources/docker-compose.yml")
	assert.NoError(t, err, "NewDockerComposeAPI()")

	t.Cleanup(func() {
		assert.NoError(t, compose.Down(context.Background(), tc.RemoveOrphans(true), tc.RemoveImagesLocal), "compose.Down()")
	})

	ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
	t.Cleanup(cancel)

	assert.NoError(t, compose.Up(ctx, tc.Wait(true)), "compose.Up()")

	// do some testing here
}
```

Use the advanced `NewDockerComposeWith(...)` constructor allowing you to specify an identifier:

```go
package example_test

import (
	"context"
	"testing"

	"github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
	tc "github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go/modules/compose"
)

func TestSomethingElse(t *testing.T) {
	identifier := tc.StackIdentifier("some_ident")
	compose, err := tc.NewDockerComposeWith(tc.WithStackFiles("./testresources/docker-compose-simple.yml"), identifier)
	assert.NoError(t, err, "NewDockerComposeAPIWith()")

	t.Cleanup(func() {
		assert.NoError(t, compose.Down(context.Background(), tc.RemoveOrphans(true), tc.RemoveImagesLocal), "compose.Down()")
	})

	ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
	t.Cleanup(cancel)

	assert.NoError(t, compose.Up(ctx, tc.Wait(true)), "compose.Up()")

	// do some testing here
}
```

### Interacting with compose services

To interact with service containers after a stack was started it is possible to get an `*tc.DockerContainer` instance via the `ServiceContainer(...)` function.
The function takes a **service name** (and a `context.Context`) and returns either a `*tc.DockerContainer` or an `error`.
This is different to the previous `LocalDockerCompose` API where service containers were accessed via their **container name** e.g. `mysql_1` or `mysql-1` (depending on the version of `docker-compose`).

Furthermore, there's the convenience function `Serices()` to get a list of all services **defined** by the current project.
Note that not all of them need necessarily be correctly started as the information is based on the given compose files.

### Wait strategies

Just like with regular test containers you can also apply wait strategies to `docker-compose` services.
The `ComposeStack.WaitForService(...)` function allows you to apply a wait strategy to **a service by name**.
All wait strategies are executed in parallel to both improve startup performance by not blocking too long and to fail
early if something's wrong.

#### Example

```go
package example_test

import (
	"context"
	"testing"
	"time"

	"github.com/stretchr/testify/assert"
	tc "github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go/modules/compose"
	"github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go/wait"
)

func TestSomethingWithWaiting(t *testing.T) {
	identifier := tc.StackIdentifier("some_ident")
	compose, err := tc.NewDockerComposeWith(tc.WithStackFiles("./testresources/docker-compose-simple.yml"), identifier)
	assert.NoError(t, err, "NewDockerComposeAPIWith()")

	t.Cleanup(func() {
		assert.NoError(t, compose.Down(context.Background(), tc.RemoveOrphans(true), tc.RemoveImagesLocal), "compose.Down()")
	})

	ctx, cancel := context.WithCancel(context.Background())
	t.Cleanup(cancel)

	err = compose.
		WaitForService("nginx", wait.NewHTTPStrategy("/").WithPort("80/tcp").WithStartupTimeout(10*time.Second)).
		Up(ctx, tc.Wait(true))
	
	assert.NoError(t, err, "compose.Up()")

	// do some testing here
}
```

### Compose environment

`docker-compose` supports expansion based on environment variables.
The `ComposeStack` supports this as well in two different variants:

- `ComposeStack.WithEnv(m map[string]string) ComposeStack` to parameterize stacks from your test code
- `ComposeStack.WithOsEnv() ComposeStack` to parameterize tests from the OS environment e.g. in CI environments

### Docs

Also have a look at [ComposeStack](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/testcontainers/testcontainers-go#ComposeStack) docs for
further information.

## Usage of `docker-compose` binary

_Node:_ this API is deprecated and superseded by `ComposeStack` which takes advantage of `docker-compose` v2 being
implemented in Go as well by directly using the upstream project.

You can override Testcontainers' default behaviour and make it use a
docker-compose binary installed on the local machine. This will generally yield
an experience that is closer to running docker-compose locally, with the caveat
that Docker Compose needs to be present on dev and CI machines.

### Examples

```go
composeFilePaths := []string {"testresources/docker-compose.yml"}
identifier := strings.ToLower(uuid.New().String())

compose := tc.NewLocalDockerCompose(composeFilePaths, identifier)
execError := compose.
    WithCommand([]string{"up", "-d"}).
    WithEnv(map[string]string {
        "key1": "value1",
        "key2": "value2",
    }).
    Invoke()

err := execError.Error
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("Could not run compose file: %v - %v", composeFilePaths, err)
}
return nil
```

Note that the environment variables in the `env` map will be applied, if
possible, to the existing variables declared in the Docker Compose file.

In the following example, we demonstrate how to stop a Docker Compose created project using the
convenient `Down` method.

```go
composeFilePaths := []string{"testresources/docker-compose.yml"}

compose := tc.NewLocalDockerCompose(composeFilePaths, identifierFromExistingRunningCompose)
execError := compose.Down()
err := execError.Error
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("Could not run compose file: %v - %v", composeFilePaths, err)
}
return nil
```
