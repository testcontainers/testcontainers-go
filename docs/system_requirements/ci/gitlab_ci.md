# GitLab CI

## Example using Docker socket
This applies if you have your own GitlabCI runner installed, use the Docker executor and you have `/var/run/docker.sock` mounted in the runner configuration.

See below for an example runner configuration:

```toml
[[runners]]
  name = "MACHINE_NAME"
  url = "https://gitlab.com/"
  token = "GENERATED_GITLAB_RUNNER_TOKEN"
  executor = "docker"
  [runners.docker]
    tls_verify = false
    image = "docker:latest"
    privileged = false
    disable_entrypoint_overwrite = false
    oom_kill_disable = false
    disable_cache = false
    volumes = ["/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock", "/cache"]
    shm_size = 0
```

!!! warning
    The environment variable `TC_HOST` needs to be configured, otherwise, a wrong IP address would be used to resolve the Docker host, which will likely lead to failing tests.

Please also include the following in your GitlabCI pipeline definitions (`.gitlab-ci.yml`) that use Testcontainers:

```yml
variables:
  TC_HOST: "host.docker.internal"
```

## Example using DinD (Docker-in-Docker)

In order to use Testcontainers in a Gitlab CI pipeline, you need to run the job as a Docker container (see [Patterns for running inside Docker](dind_patterns.md)).
So edit your `.gitlab-ci.yml` to include the [Docker-In-Docker service](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/docker/using_docker_build.html#use-docker-in-docker-workflow-with-docker-executor) (`docker:dind`) and set the `DOCKER_HOST` variable to `tcp://docker:2375` and `DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR` to empty string. 

Caveat: Current Docker releases (verified for 20.10.9) intentionally delay the startup, if the Docker API is bound to a network address but not TLS protected. To avoid this delay, the Docker process needs to be started with the argument `--tls=false`.  Otherwise jobs which access the Docker API at the very beginning might fail.

Here is a sample `.gitlab-ci.yml` that executes test with gradle:

```yml
# DinD service is required for Testcontainers
services:
  - name: docker:dind
    # explicitly disable tls to avoid docker startup interruption
    command: ["--tls=false"]

variables:
  # Instruct Testcontainers to use the daemon of DinD, use port 2375 for non-tls connections.
  DOCKER_HOST: "tcp://docker:2375"
  # Instruct Docker not to start over TLS.
  DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR: ""
  # Improve performance with overlayfs.
  DOCKER_DRIVER: overlay2

test:
 image: golang:1.21
 stage: test
 script: go test ./... -v
```
